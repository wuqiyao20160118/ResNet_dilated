# ResNet_dilated
Used in DeepLab or SiameseRPN++  
You can download ImageNet (approxiamtely 138G) on the official website. You'd better sign up by using an academic email.  
If using the dilated ResNet in object tracking, you'd better change the last conv layer to fully-connected layer.  
A powerful GPU is strongly recommanded if using ResNet34 or deeper.
